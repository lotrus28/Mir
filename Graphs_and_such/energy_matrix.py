    """Compute shortest path lengths and predecessors on shortest paths
    in weighted graphs.

    The algorithm has a running time of O(mn) where n is the number of
    nodes and m is the number of edges.  It is slower than Dijkstra but
    can handle negative edge weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       The algorithm works for all types of graphs, including directed
       graphs and multigraphs.

    source: node label
       Starting node for path

    weight: string, optional (default='weight')
       Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight

    Returns
    -------
    pred, dist : dictionaries
       Returns two dictionaries keyed by node to predecessor in the
       path and to the distance from the source respectively.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXUnbounded
       If the (di)graph contains a negative cost (di)cycle, the
       algorithm raises an exception to indicate the presence of the
       negative cost (di)cycle.  Note: any negative weight edge in an
       undirected graph is a negative cost cycle.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5, create_using = nx.DiGraph())
    >>> pred, dist = nx.bellman_ford(G, 0)
    >>> sorted(pred.items())
    [(0, None), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3)]
    >>> sorted(dist.items())
    [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)]

    >>> from nose.tools import assert_raises
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(5, create_using = nx.DiGraph())
    >>> G[1][2]['weight'] = -7
    >>> assert_raises(nx.NetworkXUnbounded, nx.bellman_ford, G, 0)

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The dictionaries returned only have keys for nodes reachable from
    the source.

    In the case where the (di)graph is not connected, if a component
    not containing the source contains a negative cost (di)cycle, it
    will not be detected.
